# Bio

I'm a third year PhD student in the [Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/). I'm advised by [Pradeep Ravikumar](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/).

Before joining Carnegie Mellon University, I completed my M.S. degree in Computer Science & Information Engineering (CSIE) at National Taiwan University (NTU). I I was a member of the Speech Processing Lab working with [Lin-shan Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/previous_version/lslNew.htm) and Prof. [Hung-yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/) in the area of machine learning and speech processing. During my undergrad years, I pursued a dual major in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics.
